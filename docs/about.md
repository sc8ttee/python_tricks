## About this site
This site is meant to be an ongoing list of python tricks as I come across them, mainly for
future reference. I use the phrase "Python Trick" as defined in Dan Bader's book:

> A short Python code snippet meant as a teaching tool. A Python Trick
> either teaches an aspect of Python with a simple illustration, or 
> it serves as a motivating example, enabling you to dig deeper and
> develop an intuitive understanding.
